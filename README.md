# Single-Player Evades.io  

This is a single-player adaptation of the popular game **Evades.io**, developed entirely in **TypeScript**. The game challenges players to navigate through intricate mazes while avoiding obstacles, with a focus on speed and precision.  

## Features  
- **Single-player gameplay**: No multiplayer functionality, ideal for solo practice and fun.  
- **Minimalist design**: Clean and straightforward interface for distraction-free gaming.  
- **Dynamic obstacles**: Test your reflexes with increasingly challenging levels.  

## Technologies Used  
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and improved code readability.  
- **HTML/CSS**: For structure and styling.  

This project is a great example of using TypeScript for game development and can serve as a starting point for adding features like multiplayer or advanced mechanics.  

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand the game! ðŸŽ®
